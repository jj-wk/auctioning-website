# Auctioning Website

In a group we built a functioning database system that achieves the capability requirements set out below in the Design Brief. The project was built using WAMP, which provides web server services on localhost under Windows using Apache, MySQL and PHP. 

The design work was to be focused on the database design and follow the structured methods taught in class. The requirements were translated as we interpreted them into what data should be stored, the transactions those data support, how the data will be modified, and who will have access to it. Furthermore, an entity relationship diagram was created to fully represent the data of interest and their relationships and attributes.
